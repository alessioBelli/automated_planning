# Automated Planning: Theory and Practice | Assignment :robot:

The aim of this assignment is twofold. First to model planning problems in PDDL/HDDL to then invoke a state of the art planner as those provided by planutils or manually compiled (e.g., fast downward, or optic). Second, to see how a temporal model could be integrated within a robotic setting leveraging the PlanSys2 infrastructure discussed in the lectures and available at https://github.com/PlanSys2/ros2_planning_system.
## The scenario
Let us consider a scenario inspired by an emergency services logistics problem, where a number of persons at known a priori locations (and not moving) have been injured. The objective of the planning systems is to orchestrate the activities of a set of different robotic agents to deliver boxes containing emergency supplies to each person.
Let’s consider these assumptions:
- Each injured person is at a specific location, and does not move.
- Each box is initially at a specific location and can be filled with a specific content such as food or medicine or tools, if empty. Box contents shall be modeled in a generic way, so that new contents can easily be introduced in the problem instance (i.e., we shall be able to reason on the content of each box).
- Each person either has or does not have a box with a specific content. That is, you must keep track of whether they have food or not, whether they have medicine or not, whether they have tools or not, and so on.
- There can be more than one person at any given location, and therefore it isn’t sufficient to keep track of where a box is in order to know which people have been given boxes!
Each robotic agent can:
– fill a box with a content, if the box is empty and the content to add in the box, the box and the agent
are at the same location;
– empty a box by leaving the content to the current location, and causing the people at the same location
to have the content;
– pick up a single box and load it on the robotic agent, if it is at the same location as the box;
– move to another location moving the loaded box (if the box has been loaded, otherwise it simply
moves);
– deliver a box to a specific person who is at the same location.
The robotic agents can move directly between arbitrary locations (there is no ”roadmap” with specific con- nections that must be taken), so the graph is fully connected.
Since we want to be able to expand this domain for multiple robotic agents in the future, we expect to use a separate type for robotic agents, which currently happens to have a single member in all problem instances.
